								<h4>Hannah Friedrich</h4>
								<p>PhD Student</p>
							</header>
							<p>Hannah started as a PhD Student in Geography at the University of Arizona in Fall 2021. Hannah completed a Bachelor’s in Geography and GIS/Cartography from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Master’s in Geography at Oregon State University within the <a href="https://www.conflict-ecology.org/about">Conflict Ecology Lab</a>. During and following her Master’s, she worked on the NASA Applied Sciences-funded Mapping the Missing Millions project, where she studied land cover change dynamics of refugee settlement establishment and growth in Northern Uganda. Hannah’s research interests are in applying remote sensing insights to human displacement and resettlement response efforts. During her PhD, Hannah aims to her expand her use of spatial data to study the effects of flooding on urban informal settlements to develop climate risk-sensitive approaches for informal settlement planning and displacement prevention.  <br><br>

								<h4>Rohit Mukherjee</h4>
								<p>PostDoc</p>
							</header>
							<p>Rohit started as a postdoc in June 2021 at the Tellman Lab. He completed his Bachelor's (Computer Science) and Master's (Remote Sensing and GIS) in India. Rohit worked in the software industry for a brief period before pursuing his Ph.D. at the Ohio State University (Advisor - Dr. Desheng Liu). In his doctoral research, he applied deep learning to improve the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of publicly available satellite datasets. He is interested in leveraging the different perspectives offered by various satellite data sources to improve our understanding of our impact on the environment. Rohit's post-doctoral research will involve mapping floods in urban areas and detecting illicit land changes in protected areas. Besides research, he loves to read and play/follow soccer. <br><br>

								<h4>Jonathan Giezendanner</h4>
								<p>PostDoc</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Jonathan started his postdoc in November 2021 at the Tellman Lab. He completed his Bachelor's (Environmental Sciences and Engineering) and Master's (Environmental and Computational Sciences and Engineering), as well as his Ph.D. (thesis directors Prof. <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/andrea.rinaldo?lang=en">A. Rinaldo</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.unive.it/data/persone/21736721/curriculum">D. Pasetto</a>) in theoretical ecology at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland.
								Jonathan is an expert in mathematical modeling, ranging from machine learning models to spatially explicit process based models. <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/273932?ln=en">His Ph.D.</a> focused on population ecology, where he developed modeling solutions to describe the dynamics of mountain species in space and time - where Earth Observation data was used to describe the properties of the landscape, and in-situ data to train the models. With his background in machine learning, modeling and hydrology, Jonathan is currently interested in advancing machine learning techniques for flood mapping (extents, intensities and risks) based on remote sensing data. Besides research, Jonathan is a <a href="https://EarlyCoffee.Games">hobby game developer</a>, beer and coffee enthusiast and avid cyclist and nordic skier.

								<h4>Alex Saunders</h4>
								<p>PhD Student</p>
							</header>
							<p>Alex will join the Lab in Fall 2022 as a Geography PhD student at the University of Arizona. His research will aim to leverage the potential of satellite data to improve financial resilience against floods, focusing on insurance and humanitarian applications. Previously, Alex worked as a technical advisor for <a href="https://startnetwork.org/">Start Network</a>, supporting NGOs to develop disaster risk financing systems to support the most vulnerable during crises. Prior, Alex worked for a global reinsurance broker as a risk analyst, modelling the possible impacts of catastrophes on insured assets. Alex completed his Geophysical Sciences undergraduate and masters degrees at the University of Leeds in the UK.
