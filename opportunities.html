							<h3>Opportunities</h3>
							
							
							<h4>Recruiting a community member to our flood recovery working group (with stipend and paid travel!)</h4>

							<p>	Funded by the Arizona Institute for Resilient Environments and Societies (AIRES) International Programs, 
								a new working group is forming at the University of Arizona to advance the use of satellite imagery to identify flood recovery and adaptation. 
								This working group builds a diverse network of researchers across the University of Arizona with additional representation from NASA, 
								international humanitarians, and community-based organizations to address flood recovery, adaptation, and resilience. 
								The working group is led by University of Arizona PhD student Hannah Friedrich and Assistant Professors Beth Tellman and Adriana Zuniga-Teran.
								Both Tellman and Zuniga-Teran are experts in bridging scientific insights with community-based solutions that mitigate vulnerability, build resilience, and promote justice. 
								We are inviting applications for a community stakeholder to join the working group activities that are ongoing thru spring 2023 and beyond. We seek applications from individuals that are involved with community-led flood recovery or adaptation efforts and are familiar with the reality of flood recovery to help us understand how data can (or can't!) play a role in informing local decision making or planning. The selected community stakeholder will attend and participate in the Global Flood Partnership Annual Meeting held September 6-8, 2022 at the University of Leeds in the UK, engage virtually in a total of three three-hour working group meetings occurring between fall 2022 and spring 2023, and attend a symposium hosted at the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ in spring 2023 showcasing the working group findings as well as other activities on flood recovery and adaptation. To learn about the Global Flood Partnership Annual meeting, visit https://gfp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/node/87.

Travel funding will be provided to the selected community stakeholder to attend the Global Flood Partnership Annual Meeting including roundtrip airfare to the UK, per diem in Leeds for three days, and ground transportation. 
								If need be, passport processing fees for travel to the UK will also be covered. 
								Additionally, travel funds will be provided to attend the symposium hosted at the University of Arizona including funds for roundtrip airfare to Tucson and per diem in Tucson for three days. 
								Lastly, to honor and thank the community stakeholder for their time and participation in the working group, an honorarium of $1000 will be provided.
								Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsLhfV7bVBVTZ7yzFUhDCRGgf_8tRxMAo3uRBW1AjLMEDV9w/viewform"><this short application</a> due June 17 to participate!

<h3>Human Environment Geography</h3>
							<p>
							
I am a human-environment geographer seeking to understand, map, and mitigate the causes and consequences of global environmental change with and for marginalized populations. I engage in a wide array of disciplines and methods from land system science, to hydrology, to the social sciences.  
I am recruiting PhD students and postdocs that are fully funded. Send your CV, a piece of writing you are proud of, and an expression of interest to my email. PhD and Master's applicants should have either expertise in or a willingness to learn satellite image analysis, programming, and quantitative skills. Applicants must also demonstrate a commitment to building a more socially just world.
We are devoted to building a diverse, inclusive, and anti-racist lab. Women and all expressions of gender identity, Black, Indigenous, and people of Color, LGBTQ people, and individuals with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.
							
								PhD applications will be accepted for Fall 2023 in January 2023.
